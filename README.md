# QuantitativeV_1.0
The project aims to share a multifunctional platform framework that can be quantified, where prediction accuracy can be replaced with models trained by the user. The example model accuracy is generally average. It includes backtesting, analysis, portfolio, and trading functions, allowing users to select their own stocks, create their own stock pool, and set date parameters.
